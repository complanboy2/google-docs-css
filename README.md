# README for `google-docs-css` #

A hopefully not-too-ugly, Shane-n-Bake style sheet for [Google Docs][1]. Mentioned in passing on [MacBreak Weekly][2], [Episode 185][3].[^fn1]

To use this dumb little thingee:

* Open `google-docs-css.css` in a text editor
* Select all and Hit `Copy`
* Open or Create a Google Docs document
* Go to `Edit > Edit CSS`
* Paste the contents of `google-docs-css.css` into the area provided
* Hit "OK"
* You should see your document re-styled immediately
* If it didn't work, either you did it wrong, I explained it wrong, or a mean wizard did something terrible to your computer. Stupid wizard.

I love you,  
[Merlin Mann][4]
